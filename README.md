# Street-Smart---Road-Lane-and-Pothole-Detection-System
Street Smart is a real-time road lane and pothole detection system built using YOLOv5 and OpenCV. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to detect lanes and potholes through a webcam and provides sound alerts for potential road hazards. Users can also upload images for basic processing like grayscale conversion.
